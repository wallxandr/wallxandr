Verse 1:
I'm a developer, I code all day
I push my code to a place called GitHub, hey hey
I collaborate with other folks
We work together, no need for jokes

Chorus:
GitHub, GitHub, it's where I store my code
GitHub, GitHub, I push and I deploy
GitHub, GitHub, it's where I share my work
GitHub, GitHub, it's where I go berserk

Verse 2:
I use branches to try out new things
I merge them when I'm ready to deploy
I use tags to mark my releases
GitHub makes it all so easy, please

(Chorus)

Bridge:
GitHub is where I keep my repos
It's my online portfolio
GitHub is where I learn and grow
It's the place where I really shine, you know

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
I use the command line, it's how I roll
I git push and git pull, that's my goal
I fix my bugs and squash my commits
GitHub helps me keep track of it

(Chorus)

Verse 4:
I use pull requests to review my code
I get feedback from other folks, it's such a load
I merge it when it's all set
GitHub makes it easy, I don't even sweat

(Chorus)

Bridge:
GitHub is where I keep my repos
It's my online portfolio
GitHub is where I learn and grow
It's the place where I really shine, you know

(Chorus)

Outro:
GitHub, GitHub, it's where I store my code
GitHub, GitHub, I push and I deploy
GitHub, GitHub, it's where I share my work
GitHub, GitHub, it's where I go berserk
